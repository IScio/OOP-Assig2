'''b) Write a Python program to get the volume of a sphere with radius 6. (5 marks)
'''
#Formular = 4/3 Pi * r * r * r

pi=3.14          # Take Pi to be 3.14
r=6              # We've been given radius as 6

v=4/3 * pi * r * r * r
v=round(v,2)     # Round off the answer to 2 decimal places
print (v)
